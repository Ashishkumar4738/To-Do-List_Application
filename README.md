# To-Do-List_Application
First, clone this repo
run the command npm install
make sure you have installed node.js in your system
you cannot use Google login for this you need to make your own Google Developer Account and there you get your own CLIENTID and CLIENTSECRET 
Replace the Mongodb URL with your local Mongodb URL(mongodb://localhost:27017/
you also need to make your own dotenv file with CLIENTID and CLIENTSECRET if you don't have then you can put anything in it but you will not be able to use the Google login 
now you are all set 
type in the console "npm app.js" to start the application.
